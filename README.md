### might need to use `sudo` for the npm commands

### `npm install` install dependencies 

### `npm run build` build changes before deploying

### `serve -s build` for local deployment

### Note: probably dont deploy here unless code has been merged to master
### `firebase deploy` for firebase deployment accessible at: https://iot-group13.web.app/ or https://iot-group13.firebaseapp.com/
